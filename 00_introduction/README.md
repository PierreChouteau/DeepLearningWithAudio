The course Deep Learning with Audio will introduce the state of the art in deep learning models applied to sound and music, with hands-on exercises on recent artificial intelligence (AI) implementations such as DDSP, AI-Duet, GANSynth, NSynth, GANSpaceSynth and SampleRNN. We will provide code templates that integrate the functionality from these open source deep learning audio projects into Pure Data programming environment. Students will be able to run, modify, access, control, input, output these deep learning models through Pure Data examples. Students will gain an understanding of the differences in input, computational cost and sonic characteristics between the different models, which will help formulate a course project. 

We will provide detailed setup instructions and automated scripts to make installation of the required tools as easy as possible (for Pure Data, Python, Conda, Magenta, PyExt). The current module of installations and course exercises only work in macOS and Linux, unfortunately Windows is not supported at the moment. You can contact https://takeout.aalto.fi and reserve a laptop computer for this course. 

Students will also learn and practice preparing data sets and traning deep learning models using cluster network in Aalto University. Students will further explore a particular model and incorporate it into their own project work. Deep Learning with Audio is a project-based course, we dedicate half of the contact hours for project work, the lecturer and the teaching assistants will support students by giving sufficient guidance, feedback and tutoring. At the end of the course, students will submit and present their projects.



## Installation of the Required Tools (Pure Data, Python, Conda, Magenta, PyExt)

First make sure you have [pyext](../utilities/pyext-setup/) set up.


## Registering Azure Lab Service 

Click on the **registration link** that you received in your email,

After registering to the Azure Lab, **My virtual machines** page will apear on your browser,

click on the **Start** button,

After the machine is started running, Click on the ‘**Connect**’ button (small computer icon). When you log in for the first time you will be asked to set a password to connect to the VM. Set up your password.


## Student Azure Lab VM Log in 

Go to https://labs.azure.com

'**Sign in**' with your aalto account,

‘**DeepLearning With Audio Lab**’ course environment will appear under '**My virtual machines**' section,

Click on the **Start** button, if the machine is already running you do not need to,

 Click on the ‘**Connect**’ button (small computer icon),

You will see a pop up with the ssh command line that you need to copy and paste into your terminal to connect to the VM,

The command line looks like this : 
**ssh -p 63635 e5132-admin@ml-lab-00cec95c-0f8d-40ef-96bb-8837822e93b6.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com**

Open a **Terminal window**, paste the command line that you copied and click on enter

Now you are in the **Deep Learning with Audio VM**
```
```
